This branch includes examples of -

- Client side rendering (CSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Server side rendering (SSR)

There are different routes created demonstrating different approach

**Suggestion** - In order to have the best outcome of the examples, I recommend to first build and run this application in production mode.

Steps to do it -

- Checkout the branch
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start` (This will start prod server on your local)
